    Protocol Updates
    (The Gravatar protocol changed, so we're changing with it)

      [rt.cpan.org 41244] (CHISEL)
    * Base URL changed to http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/
    * Ratings are now lower cased.  Upper cased ratings still
      accepted, but will be lower cased.
    * Using new http://base/id?key=value style.
    * The border key has been removed from the protocol,
      so its use throws a deprecation warning.

      ("s" instead of "size", for example).
