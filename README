NAME

    Gravatar::URL - Make URLs for Gravatars from an email address

SYNOPSIS

        use Gravatar::URL;
    
        my $gravatar_id  = gravatar_id($email);
    
        my $gravatar_url = gravatar_url(email => $email);

DESCRIPTION

    A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar for a given email address.
    This allows you to have a global picture associated with your email
    address. You can look up the Gravatar for any email address by
    constructing a URL to get the image from gravatar.com. This module does
    that.

    Examples of use include the author faces on http://search.cpan.org.

    See http://gravatar.com for more info.

Functions

  gravatar_url

        # By email
        my $url = gravatar_url( email => $email, %options );
    
        # By gravatar ID
        my $url = gravatar_url( id => $id, %options );

    Constructs a URL to fetch the gravatar for a given $email or $id.

    $id is a gravatar ID. See "gravatar_id" for more information.

    %options are optional and are...

   rating

    A user can rate how offensive the content of their gravatar is, like a
    movie. The ratings are g, pg, r and x. If you specify a rating it is
    the highest rating that will be given.

        rating => "r"   # includes g, pg and r

   size

    Specifies the desired width and height of the gravatar (gravatars are
    square).

    Valid values are from 1 to 512 inclusive. Any size other than 80 may
    cause the original gravatar image to be downsampled using bicubic
    resampling before output.

        size    => 40,  # 40 x 40 image

   default

    The url to use if the user has no gravatar or has none that fits your
    rating requirements.

        default => "https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:Mad30.jpg"

    Relative URLs will be relative to the base (ie. gravatar.com), not your
    web site.

    Gravatar defines special values that you may use as a default to
    produce dynamic default images. These are "identicon", "monsterid",
    "wavatar" and "retro". "404" will cause the URL to return an HTTP 404
    "Not Found" error instead whereas "mm" will display the same "mystery
    man" image for all missing people. See
    http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url for more info.

    If omitted, Gravatar will serve up their default image, the blue G.

   border

    DEPRECATED! This key has been removed from the Gravatar protocol. It
    will be removed from future versions of Gravatar::URL.

    Gravatars can be requested to have a 1 pixel colored border. If you'd
    like that, pass in the color to border as a 3 or 6 digit hex string.

        border => "000000",  # a black border, like my soul
        border => "000",     # black, but in 3 digits

   base

    This is the URL of the location of the Gravatar server you wish to grab
    Gravatars from. Defaults to http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/" for HTTP
    and https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ for HTTPS.

   short_keys

    If true, use short key names when constructing the URL. "s" instead of
    "size", "r" instead of "ratings" and so on.

    short_keys defaults to true.

   https

    If true, serve avatars over HTTPS instead of HTTP.

    You should select this option if your site is served over HTTPS to
    avoid browser warnings about the presence of insecure content.

    https defaults to false.

  gravatar_id

        my $id = gravatar_id($email);

    Converts an $email address into its Gravatar $id.

THANKS

    Thanks to gravatar.com for coming up with the whole idea and Ashley
    Pond V from whose Template::Plugin::Gravatar I took most of the
    original code.
